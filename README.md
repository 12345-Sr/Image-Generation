# AI-Based Image Generation Using GAN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an AI-based image generation system using a
**Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**. The model learns from the MNIST
dataset and generates realistic handwritten digit images.

The GAN consists of two neural networks:
- **Generator** – Creates fake images from random noise
- **Discriminator** – Distinguishes real images from fake images

Both models compete during training, improving image quality over time.
